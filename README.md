## DESCRIPTIONS
My portfolio website is a well-structured and visually engaging platform designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills, projects, and services. It is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes with the help of media queries. I have incorporated keyframe animations, transitions, and hover effects to enhance interactivity and user experience.

A fully functional contact form allows visitors to send messages directly to my email using EmailJS integration. Additionally, I have provided an option for visitors to download my resume in the contact section. The website also includes social media icons linking to my profiles on LinkedIn, Twitter, and GitHub. I successfully uploaded and deployed the website on Vercel, making it accessible worldwide.
